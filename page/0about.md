## Why this blog ?
Well, I spend a lot of time on PowerShell at work and I really fancy it. I wanted to share my favorite scripts and give a few advice for what they are worth.
I hope it could help other admins.

## Who is Clebam ?

My real name is Cl√©ment.
I was born in Paris, France and currently live in Rennes.

I really fancy living in Britanny, with our crepes and cider, our salted butter, our salted caramel... I love our food!
I enjoy hiking in this region, we have Saint-Malo, Mont Saint-Michel (Normandy inhabitants are going to kill me!), Broceliande Forest and the Enchanter Merlin, beaches...

I can spend hours playing video games too, my preference going to Nintendo games (Zelda, Mario) and JRPGs (Final Fantasy, Xenoblade, etc...)
I also try to play the piano. I wish I were good, and wish even more I spend as much time praticing piano as playing videogames... But let's be honest, I am not tha good.

## Why Powershell ?

PowerShell because I work as a sysadmin in a big company. We mostly use Windows systems and from time to time I needed to automate things. I started with VBScript for a few months, but got pretty soon to PowerShell.  
I took some pleasure to create scripts with PowerShell and read more and more about it. I spend hours on Reddit: [/r/powershell](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/){:target="_blank"} subreddit is pure gold.
Now I want to share what I like about PowerShell.
