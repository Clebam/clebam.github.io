### _VSCode as a PowerShell Editor_
With the recent release of PowerShell Core v6.0, it has been officialised that _Visual Studio Code_ is the new recommended PowerShell Editor. Of course, you can still use PowerShell ISE to make your scripts, but VSCode comes with some really interesting features that you definitely want to use.

## Switching from ISE to VSCode

You may have been using ISE for a while and switching to VSCode is not really in you priorities. Here are some features to reconsider the question.
* **Live debugging** : You can use Stop points and variable assignment more easily. While debugging, you can use step-to-step forwarding to enter a module function for instance.
* **Better snippets** : You can create you own snippets and call them in a more elegant manner than `CTRL+J`. More over, you can handle multiple placeholders and default values.
* **Integrated Source Control** : You can have you git or svn connected to VSCode and manage those within it.
